# emprac

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of emprac is to practice building a package in R. It contains
two datasets from my first major doctoral publication.

## Installation

You can install the development version of emprac from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("phille10/emprac")
```

## Vignette

This package contains a vignette, which demonstrates how I analyzed
these datasets and created some plots. This vignette is in the
‘vignettes’ folder, in the file ‘emprac-stats.Rmd’.
